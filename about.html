            <div class="about-text">
                <p>The University of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (UAES) Umuagwo, is a public University established by the act of Imo State Parliament Law No. 4 of 2019.</p>
                <p>The establishment of this University was a direct response of the Government of Imo State to the burning need for more credible tertiary Institutions needed to address the yearnings of the teeming youths of Imo State and the broader South-Eastern Nigeria desiring for qualitative third level education.</p>
                <p>Our institution is committed to the holistic development of students, combining rigorous academic training with character formation to produce graduates who are not only skilled professionals but also responsible citizens.</p>
                
                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>The University of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences was initially planned to take-off at the premises of Imo State Polytechnic Umuagwo (with the main campus to be at the Aboh/Okpala former proposed campus of the Old Imo State University) according to the establishment law No. 4 of 2019 as gazetted.</p>
                <p>However, this plan was reversed by Government following total rejection of this arrangement by the academic staff of the Polytechnic that coopted host communities, which was evident in the violent demonstration that disrupted activities in the Umuagwo campus of the Polytechnic for several weeks.</p>
                <p>During the same period, the earlier proposed Aboh/Okpala main campus was given tremendous facelift and the University of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences was billed to take off at Aboh/Okpala.</p>
                <p>The government of Imo State led by H.E, Hope Uzodimma(CRF) after resolving all existing issues, has moved the main campus back to Umuagwo.</p>
                
                <h3>Academic Excellence</h3>
                <p>We offer a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs designed to meet the needs of today's dynamic global environment. Our faculty comprises experienced academics and industry professionals dedicated to student success.</p>
